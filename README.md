# Recycle

Play with The AS keys or the Left Right keys. You need to Recycle the things that the duck dropped

Apple goes in green, plastic in red and newspaper in blue

This is just a simple game I made and there won't be any new updates

It is made with Pygame

# Install instructions

If you download it from [GitHub](https://github.com/Abelkrijgtalles/Recycle "GitHub") or the *.zip-file from [itch.io](https://abelkrijgtalles.itch.io/recycle "itch.io"), you need to run `main.py`.
If you download the *.exe-file, you are good to go. There is a change that you need to make a `level.txt`-file and in that you need to put `1`, but that's it.
